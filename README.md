A simple script for performing "git pull" on all repositories in a directory.

If this file is in the same directory as the repositories, you can simply perform ```./gpull.sh```
I recommend putting the file somewhere in your $PATH and renaming it to ```gpull``` so it can be run from anywhere as a command.
Make sure the file has execute permissions (```chmod +x gpull.sh```)
